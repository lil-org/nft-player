## development
* run the xcode project

## app store
Install [asc](https://asccli.sh) and Node.js, then authenticate asc with App Store Connect. The release helper uses Node for JSON parsing; no npm packages are required.

The release metadata lives in `app_store/metadata/<platform>/app-info` and `app_store/metadata/<platform>/version/<version>`, screenshots live in `app_store/screenshots/<platform>`, and asc workflows live in `.asc/workflow.json`.

```sh
asc workflow run validate
asc workflow run release
asc workflow run bump
```

Release commands resolve the app from the project bundle id and read `MARKETING_VERSION` plus `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `nft-folder.xcodeproj`. Use `ASC_APP_ID`, `VERSION`, or `BUILD_NUMBER` only when an override is intentional.

Release settings are applied through asccli commands only. `usesIdfa` requires an asc release that exposes `asc versions update --uses-idfa`; the helper stops with an explicit error instead of mutating App Store Connect through a raw API fallback.

Use platform-specific workflows when needed:

```sh
asc workflow run metadata
asc workflow run screenshots
asc workflow run release PLATFORMS:macos,tvos,visionos
asc workflow run release_ios
asc workflow run release_macos
asc workflow run release_tvos
asc workflow run release_visionos
```

Use `DRY_RUN=1` with `scripts/asc-store.sh` commands to preview supported uploads, releases, and version bumps. The helper defaults `ASC_TIMEOUT` to `180s` for slower App Store Connect review-submission requests; set `ASC_TIMEOUT` explicitly to override it.
